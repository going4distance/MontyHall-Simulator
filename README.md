Allows simulation of various MontyHall-type scenarios on a mass scale, and summarize the results.

For example:  Simulate 3 doors, one with a prize, two that lose.  The player chooses one of the doors.  Then the host opens one of the remaining two doors that has no prize, to reveal it was empty.  The player may then switch their choice to the final door.
Now run that scenario 150,000 times.  How many are successful, what percentage.  
How does that scenario compare to one where switching is not allowed?

This program will do all that.
