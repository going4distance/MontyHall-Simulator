Allows simulation of various MontyHall-type scenarios on a mass scale, and summarize the results.
For example:  Simulate 3 doors, where the host allows a switch in choice after revealing an empty door.
Now run that scenario 150,000 times.  How many are successful, what percentage.  
How does that scenario compare to one where switching is not allowed?

This program will do all that.
